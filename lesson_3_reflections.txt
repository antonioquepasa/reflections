When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?



When collaborating with other users on a project, synching the project code remotely makes it easier to work concurrently without overwriting or conflicting with other users' work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I'm not necessarily interested in all changes made by other contributors to the project.
