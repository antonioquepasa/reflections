How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It narrowed down the area to search for the bug. While I'm at it, I also want to change this file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    Bugs happen. History helps find them more easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Pro: You don't forget. Con: You sometimes introduce errors on purpose and they are saved automatically.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It's a different ball game. Programmers work on multiple files whereas text editors usually focus on a single doc at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    No clue.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    You're only a restore to previous version away from repairing a mistake :-)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Code something!
